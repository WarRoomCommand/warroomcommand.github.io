## Code
Here's some python code

We can write code pretty easily here. 

{% raw  %}
{% highlight c++ %}  <br/> code code code <br/> {% endhighlight %}
{% endraw %}

Produces something like this:

{% highlight python %}
def minimizer_func(params, samples):
    """ Params is the normal concatenation of h and Jij """
	loglikelihood = 0
	N = len(samples[0])
	dloglikelihood = np.zeros_like(params)

	for r in range(N):
		obs = calc_obs_r(r, samples)
		jr_vector, jr_ind = calc_jij_r(r, params, N)
		E = -obs.dot(jr_vector)
		loglikelihood += -np.log(1 + np.exp(2 * E)).sum()
		dloglikelihood[jr_ind] += ( -(1/(1+np.exp(2*E)) * np.exp(2*E))[:,None] * 2*obs ).sum(0)
		return(-loglikelihood, dloglikelihood)

{% endhighlight %}

Here are some quotes:

<blockquote>
    We do not grow absolutely, chronologically. We grow sometimes in one dimension, and not in another, unevenly. We grow partially. We are relative. We are mature in one realm, childish in another.
    â€”Anais Nin

Here's a list of things:
#### list
<ul>
    <li>Make code region nicer (I'm thinking solarized, with rounded corners)</li>
    <li>Actually write up Jij</li>
    <li>get at least two more fast projects done so this thing doesn't look empty</li>
    <li>IPO</li>
</ul>

All the normal Markdown stuff should carry over.

Finally, here's some math and links.

$$
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)
$$

Note that [KaTeX](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/) is work in progress, so it does not support the full range of math expressions as, say, [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/). Yet, it is [blazing fast](http://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php).
